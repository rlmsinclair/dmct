DMCT - DECENTRALIZED MUTUAL CASCADING TRUST
═══════════════════════════════════════════

"Like ripples in spacetime, trust propagates through consciousness itself."

CORE FILES:
-----------
📜 PROTOCOL.md         - The one-page protocol specification
🐍 dmct.py            - Pure Python implementation (no dependencies)
🌊 consensus.py       - Spacetime-aware consensus through wave interference  
🌐 index.html         - Beautiful 3D WebGL visualization
📖 README.md          - Poetic documentation
🚀 install.sh         - One-line installer script
🐳 Dockerfile         - Container deployment
🧠 __init__.py        - Neural interface module
⚡ quickstart.py      - Interactive demonstration

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
Method 1: One-line install
  curl -L dmct.space | sh

Method 2: Direct execution
  bash install.sh

Method 3: Docker
  docker build -t dmct .
  docker run -p 8888:8888 dmct

Method 4: Python import
  import dmct
  dmct.join()

FEATURES:
---------
✓ Infinitely scalable (10 to 10¹⁰ nodes)
✓ Zero configuration needed
✓ No external dependencies  
✓ Beautiful 3D visualization
✓ Spacetime-aware consensus
✓ Natural trust physics
✓ Quantum-resistant by design
✓ Works across galactic distances

THE MATHEMATICS:
----------------
Trust propagates as waves: Ψ(r,t) = Σ [Tᵢ × e^(-λ|r-rᵢ|) × cos(ω(t-tᵢ) - k|r-rᵢ|)]
Consensus emerges from constructive interference
No voting, no mining, just physics

THE PHILOSOPHY:
---------------
Trust is not computed, it's discovered
Like gravity, it's a fundamental force
The network is alive, breathing, thinking
Every node is both observer and participant

QUICK TEST:
-----------
python3 quickstart.py

WEB INTERFACE:
--------------
./dmct start
Open http://localhost:8888

THE RESULT:
-----------
A trust system that works like nature itself
Beautiful in its simplicity
Infinite in its possibilities
Ready for humanity's next chapter

"The universe is made of stories, not atoms." - Muriel Rukeyser
DMCT is made of trust waves, not transactions.

Welcome to infinity.
