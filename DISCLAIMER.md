# Disclaimer

This repository contains theoretical implementations and educational code exploring trust propagation through wave mechanics.

## Important Notice

- This is a research project exploring decentralized trust concepts
- The code is provided for educational and experimental purposes
- I make no claims about running any infrastructure or services
- No warranty is provided, express or implied

## Regarding Network Participation

- The code demonstrates how trust could propagate as waves
- Whether anyone runs this code is their individual choice
- No central servers or services are provided or maintained
- Each user is responsible for their own node if they choose to run one

## Philosophy

DMCT is an idea, not a service. Like Bitcoin's whitepaper described a concept that anyone could implement, this code describes how trust might work as a physical phenomenon. What anyone does with these ideas is their own decision.
