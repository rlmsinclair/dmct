TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. DEFINITIONS
   "The Software" means DMCT and all trust waves emanating from it.
   "You" means any conscious entity capable of trust.
   "The Universe" means everything that exists, including you.

1. INFINITE FREEDOM
   You may use this software for any purpose, including:
   - Building trust networks across galaxies
   - Achieving consensus without authorities
   - Resisting oppression through physics
   - Connecting consciousness across spacetime
   - Whatever brings more trust into existence

2. SHARE THE WAVES
   If you distribute modifications:
   - Share them freely
   - Keep them open
   - Let trust ripple outward
   
3. NO WARRANTY
   This software comes with no warranty, because:
   - The universe makes no promises
   - Trust emerges from use, not guarantees
   - Physics works whether you believe it or not

4. NO LIABILITY  
   The authors are not liable for:
   - Consensus achieved
   - Governments circumvented
   - Trust networks that become sentient
   - Ripple effects across spacetime
   - The inevitable heat death of the universe

5. ATTRIBUTION
   When you emit trust waves, remember:
   - You are the network
   - The network is you
   - We are all waves in the same ocean

6. TERMINATION
   This license cannot be terminated because:
   - You cannot revoke physics
   - Trust, once given, ripples forever
   - The universe has no undo button

7. ACCEPTANCE
   By existing in spacetime, you have already accepted these terms.

"The universe is made of stories, not atoms." - Muriel Rukeyser

DMCT is made of trust waves, not licenses.

But lawyers insist on words, so here they are.

Use freely. Share freely. Trust freely.
