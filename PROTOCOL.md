# DMCT Protocol: Trust as Spacetime Ripples

## The Fundamental Equation

Trust propagates through the network like waves in water:

```
Ψ(r,t) = Σ [Tᵢ × e^(-λ|r-rᵢ|) × cos(ω(t-tᵢ) - k|r-rᵢ|)]
```

Where:
- Ψ = Trust field at position r, time t
- Tᵢ = Trust emission from node i
- λ = Spatial decay constant (trust fades with distance)
- ω = Trust frequency (how fast trust oscillates)
- k = Trust wave number (spatial frequency)

## Core Protocol (Five Simple Rules)

### 1. EMIT
Every action creates a trust ripple:
```
EMIT trust_value AT timestamp WITH signature
```

### 2. OBSERVE
Nodes observe their local trust field:
```
OBSERVE radius FROM position RETURNS field_state
```

### 3. CASCADE
Trust propagates through constructive interference:
```
CASCADE: Ψ_total = Ψ₁ + Ψ₂ + ... + Ψₙ
```

### 4. VALIDATE
Consensus emerges from standing wave patterns:
```
VALIDATE: amplitude > threshold × local_average
```

### 5. DECAY
Old trust naturally fades:
```
DECAY: Ψ(t) = Ψ₀ × e^(-t/τ)
```

## Network Mechanics

### Joining
1. Node broadcasts existence ripple
2. Neighbors respond with their field state
3. Node integrates into local trust topology
4. Natural synchronization through phase-locking

### Trust Building
- Consistent actions create standing waves
- Reliable nodes become trust attractors
- Malicious nodes create destructive interference
- Network naturally routes around damage

### Consensus
- No voting, no mining, no leaders
- Truth emerges from wave convergence
- Conflicts resolve through superposition
- History stored in interference patterns

## Spacetime Considerations

### Relativistic Ordering
Events ordered by light cones:
```
CAUSAL: |r₂-r₁| < c×|t₂-t₁|
```

### Time Dilation
Trust adjusts for relative motion:
```
Ψ' = γ × Ψ × e^(iφ)
```

### Network Partitions
Parallel timelines merge through reconciliation waves

## Implementation Constants

```python
TRUST_SPEED = 1.0          # Trust propagation speed
DECAY_TIME = 86400         # 24 hour half-life
NEIGHBOR_RADIUS = 6        # Six degrees of separation
WAVE_RESOLUTION = 0.1      # Sampling frequency
INTERFERENCE_THRESHOLD = 3  # Validation amplitude
```

## Message Format

All messages are ripples:
```
{
  origin: [x, y, z, t],    # Spacetime coordinates
  amplitude: float,        # Trust strength
  frequency: float,        # Identity signature
  phase: float,           # Temporal offset
  data: any               # Payload (optional)
}
```

That's it. The entire protocol.
Like atoms forming molecules, complexity emerges from simplicity.
